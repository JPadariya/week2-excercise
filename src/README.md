# Source Code

This directory contains the main application source code.

## Structure

Organize your code by feature or module:
- `models/` - Data models and classes
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `services/` - Business logic and services
- `controllers/` - Request handlers (if building a web app)

## Best Practices

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings and comments
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python
